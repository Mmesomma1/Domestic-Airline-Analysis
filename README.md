# Domestic-Airline-Analysis
This project is an interactive dashboard analysis of domestic airlines, which transport both passengers and cargo. It explores how ticket pricing, booking timelines, flight behavior, and airline operations influence travel experiences and reveal patterns in costs and durations.
Got it ✅ — now that I fully understand your data, I’ll rewrite the README in **first person** (your perspective as the author of the dashboards) and fold in all the corrections and interpretations seamlessly, without referring back to our earlier back-and-forth. Here’s a clean, polished **README.md** for your GitHub repo:

### 1️⃣ Airline Report

This dashboard highlights ticket sales, pricing, and airline usage.

* **Total Sold Flight Tickets:** ₹6,270,094,27
* **Average Ticket Price:** ₹20,890
* **Total Airlines Considered:** 6 (Air India, AirAsia, GO FIRST, Indigo, SpiceJet, Vistara)
* Vistara and Air India generated the highest revenue.
* Morning and evening were peak travel times, while late-night activity was lowest.
* Vistara and Air India were the most used airlines; SpiceJet was the least.

### 2️⃣ Airline Behavioral Report

This dashboard explores how passenger behavior and flight type affect pricing and duration.

* **Effect of days left before flight:**
  Early bookings often show higher prices because passengers are usually booking **direct flights**, which cost more. Late bookings are cheaper in many cases, but they typically involve **multi-stop flights** that airlines use to carry goods and services.
* **Impact of non-stop flights:**
  Direct flights have higher prices because of the convenience premium.
* **Relationship between flight duration and price:**

  * Longer durations often mean higher fares when due to distance or premium service.
  * But some long flights are cheaper when stops are added to deliver goods and services, since cargo revenue helps offset passenger fares.
* **Class distribution:**

  * Business Class: 31.15%
  * Economy Class: 68.85%

### 3️⃣ Flight Report

This dashboard focuses on booking patterns, source cities, and total flight counts.

* **Total Sold Flight Tickets:** ₹6,270,094
* **Total Flights:** 300,153
* **Top Source Cities:** Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore
* **Days before booking vs ticket price:**

  * Early bookings are expensive because they are mostly direct flights.
  * Last-minute bookings are cheaper but involve more stops to deliver goods and services.
* **Count of flights per airline:**

  * Vistara: 127,859 flights (highest)
  * SpiceJet: 9,011 flights (lowest)

---

## 🚀 Key Insights

* Direct flights are more expensive because they are sold as a premium, convenience option.
* Early bookings don’t always mean lower prices — in fact, they are often **higher** because passengers buy direct flights.
* Late bookings are usually cheaper, but they involve multiple stops as the airline carries goods and services along the route.
* Flight duration generally increases with price, but stops for goods and services create outliers (some long trips cost less).
* Most passengers fly Economy class, but a significant share still books Business.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

* Airlines should **notify passengers** at booking if their flight will include stops for goods and services, so passengers can give consent.
* Passengers should be encouraged to **book early** if they prefer direct flights, as waiting may leave them with only multi-stop options.
* Booking platforms should clearly label flights:

  * **Direct (Zero Stop) — Premium Price**
  * **One-Stop**
  * **Multi-Stop (includes cargo/service stops) — Lower Price, Longer Duration**
* Provide filters so passengers can select “Direct flights only” and compare prices transparently.
* Airlines could separate cargo-heavy routes from premium passenger routes where possible to improve customer experience.
